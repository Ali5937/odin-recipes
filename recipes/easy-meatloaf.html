        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>First published January 17, 2000, Janet Shum's classic meatloaf recipe has been saved, printed, rated, and reviewed thousands of times. Topped with a tangy ketchup-mustard glaze, it's a simple comfort food recipe that checks all the dinner boxes: economical, easy, and ready in just over an hour. It makes terrific leftovers, too! Check out this rave review from last month: "Fantastic meatloaf—makes great sandwiches the day after!"</p>
